# 1. info
info sharedlibraries 查看库的加载情况

info files 查看/proc/self/maps中一些信息。

# 2. 运行时产生core文件
generate-core-file [file]

dump内存

dump [format] memory filename start_addr end_addr

dump [format] value filename expr

Dump the contents of memory from start addr to end addr, or the value of

expr, to filename in the given format.

The format parameter may be any one of:

binary Raw binary form.

# 3. 打印所有线程
thread apply all bt

bt还支持bt all，打印局部变量。

# 4. frame
https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Selection.html#Selection中

frame addr 或者 f addr

Select the frame at address addr. 

This is useful mainly if the chaining of stack frames has been damaged by a bug, 

making it impossible for GDB to assign numbers properly to all frames. 

In addition, this can be useful when your program has multiple stacks and switches between them.

On the MIPS and Alpha architecture, it needs two addresses: a stack pointer and a program counter.

https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Frame-Info.html#Frame-Info最好都试试。
